CMDA Capstone: Demonstrating Eigenvalues with a Multi Pass Pendulum

Project Description:

In a cross-disciplinary project, my Capstone group replicated and modernized Daniel Bernoulli's 1733 experiment on the motion of a pendulum with multiple masses, leveraging a combination of data science, image processing, and physical experimentation. This project, aimed at illuminating the concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, was designed as an educational tool for use in CMDA Math-Modeling classes.

Key Responsibilities and Achievements:

Physical Experimentation: Constructed a table-top model of a multi-mass pendulum, and set up a camera to capture its motion, delivering a working physical demonstration.

Image Processing & Data Acquisition: Developed Python/MATLAB code to extract image data from the recorded video and identified the location of the pendulum masses, facilitating real-time data acquisition.

Mathematical Modeling: Leveraged knowledge of dynamical systems to understand and implement the mathematical model of the swinging pendulum, effectively predicting its eigenvalues.

Data Analysis: Applied Fourier analysis on the experimental data to identify the fundamental frequencies of vibration, confirming the predicted eigenvalues of the physical system.

Software Development: Developed robust data acquisition and analysis codebase in MATLAB/Python, contributing to the project's tangible deliverables.

This project demonstrates my capabilities in scientific programming, data analysis, mathematical modeling, and physical experimentation. It showcases my ability to apply data science techniques to real-world problems, validate theoretical models with experimental data, and produce user-friendly resources for educational purposes. It also highlights my experience with image processing, Fourier analysis, and the use of MATLAB/Python for scientific computation.
